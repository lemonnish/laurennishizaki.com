New York City is full of theatrical entertainment: musicals, plays, and even movies. My favorite show by far was It's Only a Play. I loved the comic elements and all the references to and jabs at contemporary (and not so contemporary) playwrights and actors/actresses. Specifically, I recall references to Chekhov, Sarah Ruhl, Monica Lewinski, Daniel Radcliffe's small stature, Shea LaBeouf's run-ins with the law, and Lady Gaga's outrageous wardrobe.

Of course, Julia was freaking out because we got to see Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game. She was fan-girling the whole time we were waiting outside (and inside!) the movie theatre.
