This is the last picture I took in Santiago. It was the first restaurant we encountered after going through security at the Santiago airport on our way home, and the viewing experience was somewhat melancholy.

The pisco sour is the national drink of Chile, and I became a huge fan of them over the course of our trip. Unfortunately, the one pisco sour I had after returning to the states didn't even come close to the superb excellence of all the pisco sours we had in Santiago and Valpara√≠so. The pisco sours of Chile (and I speak solely from limited personal experience) contained pisco, lime or similar sour citrus, egg white, and bitters. The overall drink is inebriating yet oh so refreshing.
