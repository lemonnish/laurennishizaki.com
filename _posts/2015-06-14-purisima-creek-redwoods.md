That first picture is not overexposed, it's just the heavy morning fog. And the second to last picture does not depict a roiling green gas, it's just a bunch of airy, cloud-like grasses. The hike started at the top of the ridge. We went along at a very good clip, but realized our mistake when we got to the trail's halfway mark at the bottom, decided we wanted lunch soon, and were faced with the arduous hike back up the steep slopes.
