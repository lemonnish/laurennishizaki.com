Here are a couple last images that I wanted to share:

The financial area of Pudong forms the distinctive Shanghai skyline that is visible from across the river. From the middle of the financial district, there are tall skyscrapers in every single direction.

At night, all the buildings are lit up in an ever-changing light show.

The view outside my hotel window kept getting better and better during my stay; floor-wide cleaning and bad scheduling on the hotel's part meant that I was moved into higher and higher rooms as my stay progressed. The sky was abnormally blue when I made this panorama on the morning I left Shanghai.

A gated area a few blocks from the hotel hosts many different tech companies surrounding a large lake. The view from that area as the sun sets is fantastic.
