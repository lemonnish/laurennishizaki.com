## Tea Time
This tea house serves a wide range of teas. They also have very good milk teas, made by boiling the tea leaves in a combination of condensed milk and regular milk. Each pot of tea was served in a colorful La Creuset pot with a matching teacup. I had a very tasty rose milk tea that tasted like rose water. Before ordering, the waitress brought out a box filled with glass vials containing teas from all over the world. Wenrui and I had fun smelling the different choices and sorting them by country of origin and tea type.

## Egg Pudding

Amber brought egg pudding to work one morning, and we shared that and blueberries for breakfast. The egg pudding was served in individual egg shell bowls and was flavored with vanilla. It reminded me a bit of tapioca pudding. Tasty!

For dessert one night, we had sweet shaved ice covered in peanuts. Amber poetically named the half-eaten dish "iceberg in a sea of peanuts"

## E-Mail Coffee

This place is just around the corner from the hotel. It is a three story tall establishment that has a very bohemian chic interior with no matching light fixtures and very few matching chairs and tables. They serve a wide range of (fairly expensive) drinks, as well as various snacks, including toast and waffles. However, toast here is a large block of toasted bread served with ice cream, fruit, or dipping sauces. Wenrui and I shared a sugar-topped block of toast, paired with whipped cream, kiwi, and banana, and accompanied by three dipping sauces: condensed milk, chocolate, and mayonnaise. After ordering food, we were given a stuffed bear so that the waiters knew which table to bring the food to.

## Las Tapas

This is one of the restaurants on Hongfeng Road, near Biyun, the international district. Food here tends to be overpriced, but is also fairly tasty. Wenrui and I had delicious seafood paella and some cocktails, and we just barely escaped a sudden torrential downpour.
