Highlights of the 3-day President's Day / Valentine's Day weekend:

- Skiing at Crystal Mountain: fresh snowfall, beautiful contrast in the snow-covered trees, and me cheerfully falling down slopes
- Metric and Joywave concert: such amazing music, in an albeit slightly less awesome venue
- Cooking lobster tails with Jake: yum!!
