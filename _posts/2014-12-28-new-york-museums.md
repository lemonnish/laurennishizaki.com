Excerpt from the USS Intrepid Plan of the Day (Wednesday, 6 Dec 1961):

> MAIL SERVICE. In case you don't realize it, there are only 18 more days before Santa Claus comes sliding down the stacks. But YOU have only five more days left to get your Christmas gifts AIRMAILED. Soooo, don't wait until the last day - MAIL IT NOW! MONDAY, 11 DECEMBER 1961 (this coming Monday), is the deadline day for AIRMAIL Christmas packages. See you in the package line at the Post Office tomorrow!

## Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum

The Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum features historic and contemporary design, and was set up as a space to provide inspiration to budding designers. The current exhibits discuss user experiences, color, texture, line, tools, among others. There were also rooms devoted to the history of the museum, and a room curated by Maira Kalman. Photography is highly encouraged:
