Halfway through my stay, the hotel asked me to move rooms so they could perform extensive annual cleaning of my room. They upgraded me to a different room that actually consisted of two separate rooms containing a queen and a king bed respectively. Because I had not need for the extra bed and the room was slightly more cramped than my previous one, I asked to change rooms. A man from the front desk helped me move my things and had me sign a form with the reason for the room change:

> 客人感觉房间太大不适应
>
> "The customer feels the room is too big and she is not used to it"
