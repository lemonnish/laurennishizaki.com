excerpt: Friedrichshain is a neighborhood that is undergoing gentrification. It was an interesting place to stay and explore.

Our first Airbnb was located in the Berlin neighborhood of Friedrichshain, conveniently located a couple blocks from an U-Bahn station.

During our first full day in Berlin, Silver and I wandered our neighborhood and saw an unexpectedly large amount of anarchist material, including several apartment buildings covered in anti-police and anti-government banners. _Gentrifickt dich_ was also scrawled across the top of a building; this play on words roughly translates to "Fuck you, gentrification."

In addition to graffiti, there were a large number of paper advertisements posted on billboards and walls:

- Deutsches Theatre (a German theater company) advertised a show called _Der leere Himmel_ (The Empty Sky), featuring some of the following key phrases:
  - _Ich bin der Zorn_ (Trump): I am the fury
  - _Ich bin auch nur ein Mensch_ (FIFA officials): I am also only a man
- Ritterfest (Knight festival), featuring acrobatics, a fire show, jousting, and music.
- A wanted poster for the talk show host of a radio broadcast: _Haben Sie diesen Mann geh√∂rt?_ (Have you heard this man?)

I lost all directional credibility this first day, as I led us in the wrong direction during our grocery store search. We did eventually make it to Lidl, and even got to see some cool building art along the way.
